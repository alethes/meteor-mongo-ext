# This is somewhat counter to Meteor logic - these calls simply translate corresponding signatures and call methods
# on the server, returning results in the callback (error, result) function
# So, on one hand, aggregation framework is supposed to be (?) read-only, so it's ok that we expose all these methods
# as the client cannot alter db (?). BUT - we still expose ALL data to the client in this way, so:
# TODO some form of access control is needed.
